## Troubleshooting Guide
### Firebase Integration Issues
#### Problem: "Firebase SDK failed to load after multiple attempts"
**Possible Solutions:**
1. **CDN Accessibility**: Try switching between available CDNs:
   - Current CDN: `unpkg.com`
   - Alternative CDN: `www.gstatic.com/firebasejs`
2. **CORS Issues**: Ensure scripts have proper cross-origin attribute:
```html
<script src="..." crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
3. **Network Restrictions**: Check for any network restrictions or proxies that might block Firebase resources
4. **Browser Cache**: Clear browser cache or try in incognito mode
5. **Internet Connectivity**: Even with good connection, check DNS settings or firewall rules
6. **Firebase Configuration**: Verify configuration matches your project credentials
7. **Module Loading Order**: Ensure modules wait for Firebase initialization before importing

#### Problem: "setupAuth is not defined"
**Possible Solutions:**
1. Verify auth module exports setupAuth function correctly
2. Ensure Firebase is fully initialized before importing auth module
3. Check for circular dependencies between modules
4. Confirm proper error handling in async loading scenarios
