Project Goal:
To build an AI-powered recipe recommendation system that gets smarter the more you use it. It will learn from your likes and dislikes to suggest recipes you'll actually enjoy. The system will include:

A smart like/dislike system that learns your food preferences over time

An automatic shopping list that updates based on your chosen meals

Calendar integration so you can plan meals for the week or month

Easy swapping of ingredients based on allergies, dietary needs, or what you have at home

Voice control and search support for faster, hands-free use

A clean, user-friendly design that works well on both desktop and mobile

Nutrition info for every recipe and optional goals (like eating more protein or fewer carbs)

Family or multi-user mode so it can learn from and plan for more than one person
